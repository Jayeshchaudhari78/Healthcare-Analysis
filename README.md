# Healthcare-Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing the operations of a healthcare facility using a Power BI dashboard. The goal is to help hospital administrators and decision-makers understand important information about patient flow, resource usage, and the overall performance of the hospital. The dashboard shows data in different areas like patient demographics, bed usage, emergency room times, treatment costs, and patient feedback. This analysis helps improve patient care, make operations more efficient, and manage resources better.

## Objective
The main goals of this project are:

•	Data Visualization: Develop interactive visualizations aiding in understanding hospital metrics.

•	Data Transformation: Perform comprehensive data transformations using Power Query Editor for consistency and accuracy.

•	Data Modeling: Design an efficient data model establishing relationships between fact and dimension tables.

•	Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Develop KPIs for better insights.

•	Interactive Visuals: Create a range of visuals like bar charts, line charts, maps, and tables.

•	Custom Visuals: Utilize custom visuals for enhanced user experience.

•	Drill-Down Capabilities: Implement drill-down and drill-through functionalities.

•	Filtering and Slicing: Incorporate filters and slicers for easy data segmentation.

•	Navigation: Use navigational elements for seamless report browsing.

## Main Points

Total Patients: 2506 – This shows the total number of patients who visited the hospital.

Inpatients: 1679 – Patients who were admitted to the hospital for treatment.

Outpatients: 827 – Patients who came for consultations or treatment but weren’t admitted.

Total Staff: 262 – The total number of hospital staff.

Average Treatment Cost: 161.41 – The average cost of treatment per patient.

Average ER Time: 65.63 minutes – The average time a patient spends in the emergency room.

Patient-to-Staff Ratio: 0.10 – This shows how many patients there are for every staff member.

Total Revenue: 404.49K – The total money the hospital earned from treating patients.

Average Length of Stay (LOS): 1.70 days – The average number of days patients stay in the hospital.

## Project Overview

The Healthcare Analysis project covers several important areas affecting patient care and hospital operations. Here’s a breakdown of what the dashboard shows:

1. Patient Flow
This section tracks the number of patients admitted and discharged each week. It helps hospital managers understand trends in admissions and discharges, which can be used to plan for bed availability and staffing. For example, around 1.7K patients were admitted and 0.8K were discharged every week.

2. Bed Occupancy
This visual shows how many hospital beds are in use (1751 out of 2506). It helps managers see how well beds are being used and if there’s a need to manage patient discharges or bring in more resources.

3. Revenue by Age Group
This chart shows which age groups bring in the most revenue. The 6-20-year and 41-60-year age groups contribute the most. This helps the hospital plan services or marketing for these age groups.

4. Patient Satisfaction
This section looks at how well doctors communicate with patients about their treatments. Most patients (around 1.8K) fully agreed that their doctor explained things clearly, while a few patients were dissatisfied. This data helps the hospital improve communication with patients.

5. Emergency Room (ER) Times
This section shows the average time patients spend in the ER, broken down by department. The OPD Outpatient department has the highest average ER time at 96 minutes, while Surgery and Orthopedics departments have shorter times (about 35 minutes). This helps identify delays in certain departments and improve ER efficiency.

6. Patient Demographics (Gender)
This shows the breakdown of patients by gender, with 51.08% male and 48.92% female. Knowing the gender mix helps the hospital plan services and resources.

7. Patient Age Group Distribution
Most patients are in the 6-20-year and 41-60-year age groups. There are fewer patients in the very young (under 6 years) and very old (over 60 years) age groups. This information is useful for planning specialized care, like pediatrics for younger patients or elderly care.

8. Geographic Distribution of Patients
This section shows where patients are coming from. Most patients are from Langford (21.91%), followed by Cliffside (19.03%) and other areas like Oxford and London. This helps the hospital target services and outreach in areas with more patients.

9. Length of Stay (LOS) by Age Group
This shows the average number of days patients from different age groups stay in the hospital. Older patients (60+ years) tend to stay longer (about 2 days), while younger patients (21-40 years) have shorter stays (around 1.46 days). This helps in planning for bed availability and patient care.

10. Department Performance and Patient Status
This section analyzes the number of patients in each department and their status (ICU, discharged, normal, etc.). It helps managers understand how departments are performing and where improvements might be needed.

11. Patient Length of Stay (LOS) Breakdown
This section groups patients by how long they stay in the hospital. Most patients (1483) stay for 1-2 days, while a smaller number stay longer than 3 days. Longer stays could mean more serious cases or delays in discharge, which can be explored to improve operations.

## Conclusion
The "Healthcare Analysis" Power BI project provides valuable insights into the hospital's operations. It covers key areas like patient flow, bed usage, emergency room times, revenue, and patient satisfaction. This analysis helps improve resource management and patient care, leading to better decision-making and more efficient hospital operations. By visualizing these important metrics, healthcare managers can make informed decisions that benefit both the hospital and its patients.
